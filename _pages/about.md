As a scientist at [Schrödinger, Inc.](https://www.schrodinger.com/), I bridge the worlds of physics and drug discovery, developing cutting-edge computational solutions for life science applications.
My research journey spans from theoretical biophysics to machine learning in drug development.

At Stanford University, I conducted postdoctoral research in the [Dror Lab](http://drorlab.stanford.edu/), where I leveraged supercomputer simulations to uncover the hidden mechanisms of membrane receptor signaling. I also developed and benchmarked machine learning approaches to predict the behavior of drug candidates.

In 2019, I earned my PhD from Goethe University, based on research conducted at the [Max Planck Institute of Biophysics](https://www.biophys.mpg.de/theoretical-biophysics). There, I developed theoretical frameworks and molecular simulations to understand the fundamental physics of lipid membranes. Beyond the lab, I took on leadership roles in the German Physical Society's student organization and as the Institute's PhD student representative.

When I am not exploring the molecular world through simulations, I explore the world around me through photography, capturing the beauty of cities, landscapes, and everyday life.
