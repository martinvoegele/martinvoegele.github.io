I am a computational physicist working at [Schr√∂dinger, Inc.](https://www.schrodinger.com/) in the Life Science Software department.

Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). In my work in the [Dror Lab](http://drorlab.stanford.edu/), I used molecular dynamics simulations on supercomputers to discover signaling processes in membrane receptors and machine learning methods to predict properties and behavior of drug-like molecules. 

In Summer 2019, I defended my PhD at [Goethe University](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de) about my work in the [Department of Theoretical Biophysics](https://www.biophys.mpg.de/theoretical-biophysics) at the [Max Planck Institute of Biophysics](https://www.biophys.mpg.de). In my thesis, I investigated lipid membranes theoretically and with molecular simulations. During my time in Frankfurt, I was also active in the student organisation of the German Physical Society and in the PhD student representation of the Max Planck Society.

During my Master and Bachelor, I focused on materials physics, simulating polyelectrolytes at the [Institute for Computational Physics](https://www.icp.uni-stuttgart.de/) in Stuttgart, stress-strain behavior of alloys at the [Institute of Materials Science](https://www.imwf.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) in Stuttgart, and nanobridges of shape-memory alloys at the [Statistical and Computational Physics Group](https://www.nielaba.uni-konstanz.de/) in Konstanz.

Besides science, I find a lot of joy in photography.
